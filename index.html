			<div id="about" class="tabcontent">
				<p>She is the epitome of unrelatable posts.</p>

				<p> Her family and friends usually call her Lala.</p>

				<p>She once dreamed of being a music producer despite not having any musical talent and also her mom told her that it would require a lot of money.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="course" class="tabcontent">
				<p>When she filed an application to take the UPCAT, she said she wanted to study BS Mathematics in UPLB. She got into her first choice undergrad program and campus. However, a year later, she decided to shift into the BSCS program because she thought she'd have better career opportunities there.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="subject" class="tabcontent">
				<p>Her favorite CMSC subject, so far, is CMSC 124 even tho she is only taking the course this semester. She thinks that since it exposes you to various programming languages, it definitely boosts your programming skiilz.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="pl" class="tabcontent">
				<p>Her favorite programming language is none yet. She asks not to talk and cry about it.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="hobbies" class="tabcontent">
				<p>She likes to do a lot of things but she is never specially good at one. She can draw, using some free time learning realistic drawing. She plays various sports such as basketball, badminton, table tennis, tennis, and even tho she doesn't like volleyball because she found it violent to the self, she tried playing at least thrice. She reads a lot, not books or fictional novels tho. She is very much interested in reading articles from iflscience.com and feelings from the artidope. She somehow like writing for the sake of expressing feelings, but almost never done a satisfying writing assignment on time. She might seem so boring now as she thought she is predictable as the epitome of relatable quotes. However, as they say, <i> Jack of all trades, master of none but better than a master of one</i>. </p>

				<img src="src/bibimbap-bowl.jpg" alt="Bibimbap" class="img">While processing this page, she claims to crave for Korean Bibimbap.
			</div>
			<div id="color" class="tabcontent">
				<img src="src/spectrum.jpg" alt="Rainbow" class="img">She doesn't feel she strongly favored one color above all others. However, we are sure she prefers colored TV than the monochromatic.
