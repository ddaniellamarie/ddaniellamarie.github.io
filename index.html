		<p>I am the epitome of relatable quotes.</p>
		<p>When I filed an application to take the UPCAT, I said I wanted to study BS Mathematics in UPLB. 2 years later, I am now a sophomore in UPLB and decided to shift into the BSCS program because I thought I'd have better career opportunities here.</p>
		<p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 124 I guess tho I am taking the course this sem. Exposes you to various programming languages and definitely boosts your programming skiilz.</p>
		<p>My favorite programming language is none yet. Let's not talk and cry about this.</p>
		<p>My hobbies? I waste time watching films, reading articles online, reading comics and trying to draw.</p>
